  Description: "Seeing a parasitic sunflower really makes you wonder who made something
    like this. The sun, the literal namesake of the plant, wasn\u2019t enough so
    it wraps itself around other plants to sustain itself? I want to have a word
    with the manager of whatever God or Wizard did this."
