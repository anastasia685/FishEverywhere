  Description: Many fish have ways of defending themselves, few are so prepared for
    battle. An Acorn Hermit will change armour many times in its life, looking for
    the greatest fortress. When venturing into a forest, check the acorns for scratches
    and you may find the a legacy of tiny battles.
