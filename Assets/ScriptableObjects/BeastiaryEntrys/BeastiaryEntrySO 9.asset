  Description: "I have heard tales of a Fox Stingray that walked on four legs. \u201CPreposterous!\u201D
    I once thought, but perhaps it is not so farfetched after all. Through my research
    I have found that such rumours are oft grounded in truth. Something happened
    here long ago, and I will find it."
