  Description: "The clock struck twelve, a silence fell over the town. Baited breaths
    as the two young slingers stood ready. After the signal one of the two wouldn\u2019t
    be long for this world. The only movement, a tumbleweed drifting through the
    street. Wait no, that\u2019s a Wildberry Pufferfish!"
