  Description: "Alderman\u2019s Log. Autumn, 12th day, 189th cycle: Two more dead.
    Five more transfigured. It was the angler and his family this time. A day like
    any other, he reported, same spot and the same plan. But the fauna had changed.
    They are the anglers now, and we are but fish."
